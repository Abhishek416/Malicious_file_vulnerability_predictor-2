# Malicious-file-vulnerability-predictor

#ABSTRACT:
Malware is an executable file which is stored on the victim computer and which when executed will harm the victim computer. It has notices that there is a drastic and exponential growth in the amount of malicious software in recent years which compromises the digital security of individuals, financial institutions, businesses, and government firms. These days the malware attacks on other systems are increasing because of use of many public networks and having same subnet of network inside an organization. Using this as advantage many attackers share malicious malware to other people naming it as an important file and when the user access it the malware gets deployed and the system gets corrupted. So, to avoid and help the user identify whether malware is present in the system or not. So to do this we need malware dataset with which static analysis can be done with malware signatures. Our aim in this project is to classify the malware in multiclassification using the proposed machine learning models. To classify using static analysis we build our own dataset by scanning the hash files and which then the result will be stored in a json file. This json file will be converted to csv file to train our machine learning model.


#Methods:
i)	file scanning through virus total
ii)	conversion of obtained json to csv files
iii)	Getting the columns from the dataset which we will consider for the input features
iv)	Extracting the details from each column to get the result more detailed
v)	ML algorithms to train and test the dataset
vi)	Saving the best machine learning model for future testing
vii)	testing the multiple files sha256 code in the input text file
viii)	Getting prediction for each file with the vulnerability percentage
ix)	Adding detailed output for each file to specify the malicious rate.
